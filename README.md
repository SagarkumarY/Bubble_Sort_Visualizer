A simple, clean, and beginner-friendly project to visualize the **Bubble Sort algorithm** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This visual tool helps learners understand how bubble sort works step-by-step by watching bars move and swap in real-time.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- The array `[50, 20, 80, 10, 30, 60]` is visualized as vertical bars
- When you click **Start Sorting**, the Bubble Sort algorithm begins:
  - Compares two bars at a time
  - Highlights them in orange
  - Swaps if needed
- Sorting continues until the whole array is sorted
